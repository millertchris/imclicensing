<p><strong>Episode Transcription</strong></p>



<p><strong>Emily Randles:</strong>&nbsp;Hello listeners.&nbsp; Today&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;talking with Lauren DeLapa&nbsp;with&nbsp;IMC.&nbsp; Lauren&nbsp;joined the IMC team&nbsp;in&nbsp;December 2019&nbsp;and is just six months on the job.&nbsp; We thought it would be good to get her&nbsp;fresh&nbsp;perspective on licensing and what&nbsp;she’s&nbsp;learned so far about the industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;We’ll&nbsp;also cover how other marketing skills&nbsp;can&nbsp;translate into&nbsp;licensing which will help those of you considering a career in the licensing field,&nbsp;and then finally we’ll dig into other questions she might have for me. Thanks for tuning in and remember to subscribe&nbsp;and check back often for new episodes.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp;please send us an&nbsp;email if you have any&nbsp;follow-up&nbsp;questions for me or Lauren,&nbsp;or if there is a&nbsp;topic&nbsp;you’d like&nbsp;us to cover.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hi Lauren, thanks for joining us today.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lauren DeLapa:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi Emily, thank&nbsp;you so much for having me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m&nbsp;so excited to be on the Brand Licensing Podcast.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ER:</strong> Yes, yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;We’re&nbsp;excited&nbsp;to have you as our first visitor and guest speaker.&nbsp; So now that&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;a seasoned&nbsp;licensing professional with six months on the job, we wanted to get your perspective on brand licensing and what you’ve learned&nbsp;so far.&nbsp; But before we get started, can you give us a rundown on your resume?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>LD:</strong> Sure thing.&nbsp; So, like you said,&nbsp;I am very new to IMC.&nbsp;I’m&nbsp;only six months on&nbsp;the job right now, but&nbsp;I’ve really been enjoying it so far.&nbsp; And&nbsp;before my time&nbsp;at IMC I was actually not in licensing, so my background was&nbsp;primarily in marketing&nbsp;and communications in a variety of different roles all&nbsp;across&nbsp;the country&nbsp;and&nbsp;in a variety&nbsp;of organizations, too, from non-profit work&nbsp;to working in a university setting.&nbsp; I’ve kind of been&nbsp;all across&nbsp;the board&nbsp;and I also have a degree in Communications from the University of&nbsp;Minnesota.&nbsp;So&nbsp;I am fresh into licensing like&nbsp;we&nbsp;talked about earlier,&nbsp;I am only&nbsp;six months into the licensing industry,&nbsp;but really enjoying it so far&nbsp;and excited to talk about my experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ER:</strong> Great, thanks.&nbsp; To date, what has been&nbsp;the thing that&nbsp;has&nbsp;surprised you most learning about licensing?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>LD:</strong> Sure.&nbsp;So&nbsp;coming into licensing I had a very fresh perspective&nbsp;and licensing as a whole was so new to me and still is&nbsp;relatively.&nbsp;&nbsp;So&nbsp;coming in&nbsp;I think the thing that surprised me the most&nbsp;was how surrounded we are&nbsp;by licensing without even knowing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;So&nbsp;from my perspective&nbsp;being&nbsp;new to licensing,&nbsp;I remember my first week on the job&nbsp;and training&nbsp;and&nbsp;going out&nbsp;and doing&nbsp;retail audits all over. All the Target’s and Walmart’s and Home&nbsp;Depot’s&nbsp;and walking through the aisles and realizing how many products&nbsp;on the shelf&nbsp;were licensed&nbsp;was a shock to my system.&nbsp; I&nbsp;couldn’t&nbsp;believe it.&nbsp; Even small things&nbsp;like going down the ice cream aisle you can grab a&nbsp;pint of Reese’s Peanut Butter&nbsp;Cup&nbsp;ice cream and think&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;buying a product from Reese’s&nbsp;and turns out it was licensed.&nbsp; It’s insane when you take a step back and&nbsp;look at retail from licensing perspective how&nbsp;many products on shelf&nbsp;are licensed,&nbsp;and,&nbsp;I think&nbsp;from my perspective being&nbsp;new&nbsp;in&nbsp;the industry,&nbsp;it’s exciting to see how far of a reach licensing has, and&nbsp;I’m still surprised to this day how&nbsp;far licensing can go and how innovative product extensions can be.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ER:</strong> Great.&nbsp;No,&nbsp;that’s&nbsp;awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s&nbsp;been the&nbsp;most difficult thing you’ve learned about licensing?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>LD:</strong> Most difficult thing. So, I think for me&nbsp;I, to provide some context, work in client services&nbsp;for IMC, so a lot of my day to day is dealing with clients and the different agreements&nbsp;that&nbsp;we manage,&nbsp;licensees and&nbsp;licensors both, so when I first started I think one of the challenges&nbsp;that I faced was jumping into programs that had been existing for years&nbsp;before I started IMC. I&nbsp;mean&nbsp;I’m&nbsp;not even a year&nbsp;in&nbsp;yet. So,&nbsp;for me from the Client Services side there was a lot of catching up to do&nbsp;&nbsp;when it came to understanding agreements&nbsp;from the beginning&nbsp;all the history and context that leads you up to the current day of the agreement. Different products&nbsp;that&nbsp;they’ve&nbsp;had in the past, current products, products that they’re planning to launch in the future.&nbsp; I mean&nbsp;there’s&nbsp;a lot to a single agreement.&nbsp; Coming into IMC we have a lot of different clients, a lot of different agreements.&nbsp;&nbsp;So&nbsp;there was a lot of catch up&nbsp;to do which is exciting when you have a new job&nbsp;and I was excited to learn. But&nbsp;there’s&nbsp;a lot to get a handle on when starting client services.&nbsp; You really&nbsp;have to&nbsp;jump in head-first.&nbsp; I think the other side of that, too, one difficult thing&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;starting in client services&nbsp;for the first time&nbsp;is building&nbsp;relationships.&nbsp; So like I mentioned earlier, we have client relationships that have been going on for years and we have&nbsp;contacts with certain brands that they’ve been talking to the same person in client services at IMC&nbsp;for years,&nbsp;as well. So&nbsp;being able to come in and build new relationships and make it an&nbsp;easy transition for our clients&nbsp;that was really important&nbsp;to me and something that I had to put the initiative&nbsp;in to make sure that was happening and that can be difficult when learning&nbsp;all the ins and outs of a new job,&nbsp;and also making sure that clients aren’t feeling a tumultuous shift as&nbsp;you&nbsp;start in a new world.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ER:</strong> You know relationships are a big part of this industry,&nbsp;and&nbsp;so yea, it does take some time to build those&nbsp;and&nbsp;can be challenging&nbsp;especially&nbsp;right now&nbsp;that&nbsp;face-to-face time&nbsp;is a little bit unheard&nbsp;of&nbsp;in the current period,&nbsp;so just&nbsp;doing everything by phone calls can make it harder to build those relationships.&nbsp;So&nbsp;keep working&nbsp;at it.&nbsp;&nbsp;So&nbsp;you have a marketing and communications background, but&nbsp;have you been able to use those skills effectively&nbsp;in your licensing role?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>LD:</strong> Well I am a big believer&nbsp;in communication being&nbsp;the foundation to everything you do both professionally and personally.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;strong&nbsp;communication skills&nbsp;get you so far and I 100% found that to be true&nbsp;within&nbsp;licensing.&nbsp;&nbsp;So&nbsp;for me, like you said, I have the background in&nbsp;communications&nbsp;roles and marketing roles and those things have very much translated into my day to day in licensing specifically&nbsp;and&nbsp;client services&nbsp;and&nbsp;account management.&nbsp;&nbsp;So&nbsp;when it comes to relationships and getting to know licensees and licensors&nbsp;and building trust with your clients,&nbsp;I think clear communication, concise communication,&nbsp;regular communication it’s so important.&nbsp; Also being adaptable in how you communicate&nbsp;as well in knowing that one licensee&nbsp;or one client&nbsp;may communicate in a very different way than the next one and the next one.&nbsp;And so&nbsp;being able to have your communication&nbsp;be mendable to different&nbsp;people&nbsp;in different circumstances I found to be a skill that has translated in past jobs&nbsp;and also&nbsp;within licensing.&nbsp; Then from the marketing perspective I would&nbsp;say licensing definitely requires creative thinking&nbsp;whether that is on the client services side of tackling different problems and trying to solve them&nbsp;in an innovative way or creative way&nbsp;or a way&nbsp;that is perfectly matching the needs of your client.&nbsp; I mean I know that this is&nbsp;something that is required on the business&nbsp;development side as well,&nbsp;where you have to be a creative thinker&nbsp;when&nbsp;going outside of the box of really innovative product extensions&nbsp;and things of that sort.&nbsp;&nbsp;So&nbsp;I think a lot of those foundational aspects of really strong communication&nbsp;that&nbsp;is required&nbsp;within the communications role&nbsp;and also&nbsp;the creative side of marketing.&nbsp; Those are two things that do pop up&nbsp;in licensing,&nbsp;I think,&nbsp;no matter what&nbsp;role&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;in within the&nbsp;licensing&nbsp;industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ER:</strong> That’s&nbsp;really helpful.&nbsp;I&nbsp;especially&nbsp;think that&nbsp;would be helpful for those thinking of a&nbsp;career in licensing&nbsp;for the future.&nbsp; Speaking of that, what advice would you give&nbsp;a new person who is considering licensing for their next role?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>LD:</strong> I would say “do it”.&nbsp; Licensing is the best.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;so enjoyed my time in licensing.&nbsp;&nbsp;So&nbsp;I would definitely recommend to take the plunge, but&nbsp;on a more serious note, I would say research.&nbsp; If&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;interested in licensing or have any&nbsp;inkling that’s something you want to explore, definitely&nbsp;dive in to researching where&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;you would be the best fit.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;the thing that is&nbsp;really nice&nbsp;about licensing is that you can be on the client services side, you could&nbsp;be on the sales side or the business development side.&nbsp;&nbsp;There’s&nbsp;a lot of variety to roles just within one licensing agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;So&nbsp;I think&nbsp;really assessing your skill sets and your strengths and what you want out of&nbsp;a role and&nbsp;a&nbsp;future career.&nbsp; If you&nbsp;hone in on&nbsp;those specifics, chances are you’ll find a really good fit for yourself within licensing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ER:</strong> Great, and as you mentioned&nbsp;in&nbsp;your experience,&nbsp;so&nbsp;you&nbsp;have&nbsp;started here with IMC&nbsp;in an agency role.&nbsp;But&nbsp;so&nbsp;what do you like about working as a licensing agent&nbsp;and what do you dislike maybe about&nbsp;working as licensing agent? So when people are considering a licensing role they&nbsp;could also work for a brand in licensing&nbsp;or a manufacturer or licensee&nbsp;in licensing or even work&nbsp;within the industry in a&nbsp;kind of supply or services piece into the licensing industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;So&nbsp;what is it about the agency life that you like and dislike?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>LD:</strong> Sure.&nbsp;So&nbsp;I’ll go ahead and start with my likes first. I would say what I really like about working&nbsp;within the licensing agency and&nbsp;that’s&nbsp;a licensing agent is the variety.&nbsp;I’m&nbsp;definitely the type of person who&nbsp;loves new change, new challenges, new opportunities and so being in licensing you have such an array of clients to work with.&nbsp; You have a portfolio&nbsp;that is changing and&nbsp;that’s&nbsp;really exciting to me being able to have consistent clients that you’re working with but also have new opportunities come through the door&nbsp;often.&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s&nbsp;exciting to me. So I think the variety and not just the amount of clients that can come&nbsp;in&nbsp;and how your roster can grow, but also how each agreement can differ&nbsp;and what brand you’re working with,&nbsp;what categories they’re in.&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s&nbsp;exciting as well. So not only are you getting opportunities that come in often, but&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;also getting variety from agreement to agreement and client to client.&nbsp;&nbsp;So&nbsp;I find that to be really exciting. And, I&nbsp;would give a bonus like to just the client interaction&nbsp;from the client services perspective.&nbsp; I know&nbsp;we’ve&nbsp;talked about it earlier, but I really do value the client connection and building relationships and seeing your clients succeed.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;really rewarding to have that&nbsp;piece in the client services role that I’m in.&nbsp;So&nbsp;bonus&nbsp;point for all the client relationships that we get&nbsp;in&nbsp;in licensing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So&nbsp;for dislikes I would say&nbsp;part of my like kind of plays into my dislike.&nbsp;&nbsp;So the variety is great but&nbsp;part of licensing is the “come and go” nature of clients and agreements where one day you can have&nbsp;an opportunity and it looks great and the next the opportunity cannot be&nbsp;a fit&nbsp;anymore&nbsp;and&nbsp;not be&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of your day to day work, and&nbsp;I think&nbsp;that’s just the licensing industry&nbsp;and&nbsp;that’s&nbsp;something I’ve learned already in my first few months&nbsp;of working at IMC that you know we’re going to have opportunities&nbsp;that&nbsp;come in we’re going to have opportunities that&nbsp;go out and they’re not always going to stick.&nbsp;And I think we’re putting in the work&nbsp;you are really excited for a certain project it might&nbsp;not&nbsp;work&nbsp;out, that will always be a bummer no matter what role you’re in.&nbsp;But in licensing you definitely see shifts that happen&nbsp;and agreements that you think are going to go through and maybe they don’t or a product launch for one of&nbsp;your existing clients&nbsp;that seems really great and ends up not sticking at retail and&nbsp;so&nbsp;you end up having&nbsp;to take a step back&nbsp;and you can put all the work in and maybe you didn’t see that&nbsp;final product or final conclusion that you were hoping for which can be a bummer. But I think at the end of the day the&nbsp;ones that do stick and the ones that go through make it all worth it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ER:</strong> Great. Yea, those are great examples. So&nbsp;as an industry expert with&nbsp;14 years of experience in licensing, what questions do you have for me?&nbsp;&nbsp;So&nbsp;what are you still curious about&nbsp;in terms of executing a licensing deal&nbsp;or managing a licensing program?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>LD:</strong>&nbsp;Sure, so what advice would you give yourself&nbsp;at my age&nbsp;and my&nbsp;type of role&nbsp;in&nbsp;my point in my career&nbsp;knowing that you’re President of a licensing agency&nbsp;now, what advice would you pass down to&nbsp;a younger version of yourself?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ER:</strong> That’s&nbsp;a great question because I did start&nbsp;in licensing in my mid-twenties&nbsp;and&nbsp;so I can definitely relate.&nbsp; I would say a couple of things. One definitely,&nbsp;and&nbsp;you’ve touched on relationships a little bit,&nbsp;but making sure you’re&nbsp;making those strong connections and&nbsp;relationships and&nbsp;building those and fostering them&nbsp;and so when you’re meeting somebody&nbsp;connecting with them&nbsp;on LinkedIn, following up and just&nbsp;keeping those connections as much as possible, because you never know when they’re going to come back&nbsp;and&nbsp;you’re going&nbsp;to need a connection in apparel or a connection in ice cream and so having that resource of LinkedIn and&nbsp;those just touch points would be really helpful.&nbsp; I would also recommend you know diversifying your experience&nbsp;near a portfolio and just building your own&nbsp;brand so that again the more you build yourself within your licensing career the more valuable you are not only to IMC but&nbsp;to&nbsp;the clients&nbsp;and to others around you.&nbsp;So&nbsp;you&nbsp;know staying focused on your goals&nbsp;and career to grow further within the industry.&nbsp; And then I think the third thing I would say&nbsp;is just reading and researching as much as possible as to what is going on in the industry so making sure you’re subscribed to&nbsp;industry publications and reading the data&nbsp;and knowing when it comes&nbsp;you know&nbsp;the magazines and publications come&nbsp;out reading&nbsp;them&nbsp;as well.&nbsp; Really helpful to be knowledgeable and&nbsp;so know&nbsp;when you run into problems you can say “well I saw so and so over here&nbsp;did this&nbsp;maybe we can do something similar” and&nbsp;the&nbsp;clients&nbsp;also really look for examples within the industry&nbsp;that are&nbsp;going on.&nbsp;So&nbsp;if you’re not staying dialed&nbsp;in terms of what’s going on&nbsp;it’s hard to offer that perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>LD:</strong> That’s great advice.&nbsp; I know you&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;see me&nbsp;since this is a podcast, but I’m taking notes. I always appreciate your expertise, Emily.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ER:</strong> Great, great.&nbsp; Well&nbsp;that’s&nbsp;all we had for today and wanted to just Lauren thank you so much for your time&nbsp;and sharing your insights and perspective&nbsp;as&nbsp;fresh as they are.&nbsp; I think it’s really great for others to get the perspective of&nbsp;someone new and&nbsp;for&nbsp;someone like myself who is a seasoned&nbsp;person in licensing to&nbsp;hear how it’s shaping your&nbsp;career and&nbsp;influencing the things that you’re working on.&nbsp;So&nbsp;it’s very exciting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One final question we have before we sign off is,&nbsp;what’s&nbsp;the craziest&nbsp;or worst licensed product you’ve come across in your career to date?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>LD:</strong> Oh man I love this question.&nbsp;&nbsp;Craziest or worst licensed product.&nbsp; You know I, if anyone knows me, I am totally&nbsp;obsessed with&nbsp;my&nbsp;dog, Captain, and I’ll talk about him as much as I can&nbsp;and&nbsp;I’ll have to say being a pet parent there are some&nbsp;crazy pet products out there and a lot of them are licensed.&nbsp;So&nbsp;I think the pet channel in licensing is really popping off right now. It is insane the products&nbsp;you can find.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ER:</strong> Lauren, thanks again for your insights and for your time and I can’t wait to see what other crazy&nbsp;pet products&nbsp;you come across,&nbsp;and wish you&nbsp;the best as we continue&nbsp;to work together and grow your career.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>LD: </strong>Thank you so much, Emily.&nbsp; I was so excited to come on the podcast and it was great&nbsp;being able to chat with you.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Licensing is a relationship not merely between brands, but among people. At IMC, we build and nurture both of those relationships while delivering top-notch customer care that treats — and protects — your brand as if it were our own. </p>

                        <p>We’re committed to fostering dynamic brand alliances. Often those alliances are born from one brand’s need and another’s ability to meet that need. The IMC team are experts at recognizing and creating those opportunities, but our real expertise is people. Standing side by side, as consultants, partners, peers, and as friends, we’re driven by a singular purpose: creating a smart idea.</p>
